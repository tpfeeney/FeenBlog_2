  abstract = {Background: Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers used to treat postoperative urinary retention (POUR) may also have a preventative role. Here we assess the evidence behind their prophylactic use on POUR prevention. Study design: PRISMA guidelines were followed. All studies reviewed for eligibility, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Pooled risk ratios with 95\% confidence intervals calculated using a random effects model. Heterogeneity assessed using Forest plots, I2 statistic and Chi-squared Cochran's Q-statistic.
Results: Fifteen RCTs (1732 patients) included. Prophylactic alpha-1 adrenergic blockers significantly reduced risk of POUR, 13.16\% vs 30.24\%, RR \textonequarter{} 0.48 (95\%CI: 0.33; 0.70, p-value \textonequarter{} .001), without a statistically significant increase in adverse events. Substantial heterogeneity found between included studies (I2 \textonequarter{} 65.49\% [95\%CI:48.49; 95.01] \& Q-statistic 43.46 (p-value{$<$}.001)). Subgroup analysis revealed strong risk reduction and little heterogeneity in males (RR:0.33, 95\%CI:0.23; 0.47, p-value{$<$}.001, I2:10.58) and patients receiving spinal anesthesia (RR:0.26, 95\%CI:0.14; 0.46, p-value{$<$}.0001, I2 \textonequarter{} 0\%).
Conclusion: Prophylactic alpha-1 adrenergic blockers reduce risk of POUR in males and after spinal anesthesia.},
