<td><a href="https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/"><strong>Improving Your Statistical Inferences</strong></a></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><a href="https://hbiostat.org/"><strong>The Harrell-verse</strong></a></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><a href="https://understandinglinearalgebra.org/preface-1.html"><strong>Undertanding Linear Algebra</strong></a></td>
<td>Another linear algebra resource? Yes, but that is only because I also found this helpful when teaching myself the subject. Can’t have too much of a good thing anyway, right?</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><a href="https://r-universe.dev/search/"><strong>R-Universe</strong></a></td>

<td><a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/index.htm"><strong>SticiGui</strong></a></td>
<td>Online statistics textbook by Philip Stark at Berkeley. I really enjoy that it covers a first course in stats, but also included logic and set theory instead of glossing over that.</td>
