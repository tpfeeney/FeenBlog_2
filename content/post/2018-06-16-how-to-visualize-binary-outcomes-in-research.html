<p>In my research I frequently want visualize outcomes over groups. The nature of clinical reserach means that often times outcomes are binary and I want to find the proportion of binary outcomes over groups. This was not straight forward for me, so I decided to make a post about it.</p>
<p>###load libraries</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)</code></pre>
<p>###create the variables</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(15762)
death&lt;-rbinom(1000,1,0.03)
readmit &lt;-rbinom(1000,1, 0.1)
id&lt;-rbinom(1000,5,0.2)</code></pre>
<p>###combine into dataframe</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- data.frame(death,readmit,id)
names(x) &lt;- c(&quot;death&quot;, &quot;readmit&quot;, &quot;id&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>###check the results</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(x)
##   death readmit id
## 1     0       0  2
## 2     0       0  0
## 3     0       0  0
## 4     0       0  3
## 5     0       0  2
## 6     0       0  0</code></pre>
<p>Now here is where it was tricky for me. If you, like I typically do, work with large data then you will need to extract the components you want. Typically for the specific outcome I am interested in, iâ€™ll use <code>na.omit(df)</code> to restrict to only observations with all outcomes observed; excluding NAs</p>
<p>So once you do that you want to select out the binary outcome you are interested in, and I will be using death as the outcome to evaluate.</p>
<p>###pull out the observations I am interested in the proportion of death across different IDs</p>
<pre class="r"><code>death_x &lt;-dplyr::select(x, death, id)</code></pre>
<p>###create proportion table to get proportion of deaths across different IDs</p>
<pre class="r"><code>death_prop &lt;- death_x %&gt;% count(death, id) %&gt;% mutate(prop=prop.table(n))</code></pre>
<p>###now just look at the proportion of those that died; this next step basically makes sure we only visualize the proportion of death</p>
<pre class="r"><code>death_prop &lt;- dplyr::filter(death_prop, death==1)</code></pre>
<p>###then just graph it; ive chosen to use a lollipop plot, because I think that is the best</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(death_prop, aes(x=id, y=prop)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_segment( aes(x=id, xend=id, y=0, yend=prop))+theme_classic()+geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0))+labs(x=&quot;ID #&quot;, y=&quot;Proportion of Death&quot;, title=&quot;Variability in Death over ID&quot;)</code></pre>
