## What is this blog about and what can I expect?

This is my professional site. I am interested broadly in STEM fields and may post on a wide range of topics from paper dissections, discussion of topics, and of course R for statistical analysis. 

This tweet

got me much more intersted in using this as a learning experience for both myself and anyone who finds their way here. Of course, the process of writing a bog post and organizing your thoughts to teach someone else will only help educate the writer.


_**Disclaimer:**_ as mentioned, this site is a work in progress. Sometimes I will break it as I learn how to build the site using Rstudio and the Blogdown package. If you see any issues with posts, such as factual inaccuracies or a poorly/un attributed comment please let me know--I am very open to constructive and friendly criticism.



Please feel free to look around. This is just the beginning and I plan on making more posts
