Name/Title | Description
-----------|-----------
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)|Not much to say other than this is THE package for making figures and graphs|
|[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)| This is like ggplot2 but for data manipulation; wonderful/amazing|
|[tableone](https://github.com/kaz-yos/tableone)|A wonderful package for making table 1 in medical/epi papers, does unvariate calcs automatically and is exportable to excel. A total must use. The Github Page also lists some other packages that I like to use too, but all are nice for different reasons|
|[mgcv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html)|A package for GAMs. Some explanations [here](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/mgcv/tampere/mgcv.pdf) and [here](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/mgcv/). This package is what I learned GAMs with and Noam Ross' course (listed in my fav resources page) uses it too. great stuff.|
