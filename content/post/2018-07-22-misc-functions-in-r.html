<p>This post is VERY in progress. The point is as a reference for myself for small things I want to refer to in the future, for simulating data and working with probability distributions. Its a hodge podge and always being updated</p>
<p>How to get session info and version information for an R session
<code>sessionInfo()</code></p>
<p>see loaded packages
<code>search()</code></p>
<p>see the commands that are contained within a package
<code>lsf.str("pakcage:name")</code></p>
<p>list all objects in a package
<code>ls("package:name")</code></p>
<p>if package is not loaded can use
<code>help(package = name)</code></p>
<p>#Probability Distributions: A gentle introduction on how to use the different commands.
There is a good tutorial here too: <a href="http://ww2.coastal.edu/kingw/statistics/R-tutorials/prob.html" class="uri">http://ww2.coastal.edu/kingw/statistics/R-tutorials/prob.html</a></p>
<p>Can use <code>?Distributions</code> to pull up the list of distributions covered in R
start with the <code>dnorm</code> distribution.</p>
