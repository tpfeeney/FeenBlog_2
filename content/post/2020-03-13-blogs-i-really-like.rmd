Online Resources I Find Helpful
---
Title and Author | Description and/or Extra Material
---|----
[**Introduction to Modern Causal Inference**](https://alejandroschuler.github.io/mci/)|by Alejandro Schuler. Such a fantastic general introduction to casual thinking from a more technical viewpoint. It is a work in progress|
[**Statistics Notes in the BMJ**](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/pubs/pbstnote.htm)|An online repository of all the Statistics notes published in the BMJ by Martin Bland and the late Doug Altman. What a treasure trove.|
[**Notes and resources by David Freedman**](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~freedman/)|Page with links to many of the late David Freedman's notes and papers, which are quite high quality.|
[**Improving Your Statistical Inferences**](https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/)|by Daniel Lakens. Its a great resource for understanding more about epistemology and how it relates to statistical inference. It is a work in progress, but has exercises and is reasonably regularly updated|
[**The Harrell-verse**](https://hbiostat.org/)| The Frank Harrell Jr. universe for stats education. Included gems like [Biostatistic for Biomedical Researchers](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/), links to his frequented sites, rec'd blogs, etc.|
[**Interactive Linear Algebra Book**](https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/index.html)| Interested in learning linear algebra? Want to have an interactive textbook the allow manipulation of 3-d objects? This is the place.|
[**Linear Algebra for Data Science**](https://shainarace.github.io/LinearAlgebra/index.html)| By a UNC graduate in Stat and Operations Research, Shaina Race Bennett. It's a fantastic introduction to linear algebra and the immediate relevance for statistics.|
[**Undertanding Linear Algebra**](https://understandinglinearalgebra.org/preface-1.html)| Another linear algebra resource? Yes, but that is only because I also found this helpful when teaching myself the subject. Can't have too much of a good thing anyway, right?|
[**R-Universe**](https://r-universe.dev/search/)|Searchable database of R packages. Nice and visually appealing, and nice to search than CRAN|
[**Draw Data**](https://drawdata.xyz/)|Have data in mind, and want a dataset to exist with data in a specific pattern? Well here you can draw the pattern and output a dataset to correspond with that pattern.|
[**UNC Causal Inference Research Group**](https://causal.unc.edu/)|The research group of which I am a member. Has monthly talks.|
[**Epidemiolog.net**](http://www.epidemiolog.net/)|Victor Schoenbach's page of resources. Vic was a professor of epidemiology at UNC for many years, and this is also a treasure trove of material.|
[**R Pscyhologist**](http://www.epidemiolog.net/)| Visualizations of many statistical phenomena with interactive shiny based widgets. Great for education|
[**SticiGui**](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/index.htm)| Online statistics textbook by Philip Stark at Berkeley. I really enjoy that it covers a first course in stats, but also included logic and set theory instead of glossing over that. |

[**Society for Causal Inference**](https://sci-info.org/)|Relatively new society but worth joining to gain access to growing content|
[**Society for Epidemiologic Research(SER)**](https://epiresearch.org/)|Good organization for those interested in epi research, particularly if there is interest in methods|
[**American Statistical Association**](https://www.amstat.org)| Interested in statistics or biostat? This is self explanatory|
