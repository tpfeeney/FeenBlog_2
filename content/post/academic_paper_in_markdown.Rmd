## Background:
I was interested in writing an academic paper in RMarkdown, but I am a n00b and it wasnt immediately obvious to me how to format everything. So I did a little searching around and have found two solutions, which I think are pretty good. One solution, which I'll call the basic YAML version, requires only some moderate reformatting of YAML header in an RMarkdown file. The other solution, which I call augemented YAML, requires some extra files called `.lua` files, which add extra features but end up making it look nicer in the end. My goal here was to end up with a document with a reasonable title page, a single spaced abstract section with Keywords at the end, and a two colum paper that I could insert figures into. Also, I needed it to have line numbers.

For this you will need to have a $LaTeX$ distribution installed, pandoc, and be able to at least knit to PDF. I use RStudio for all of this. Knowing some HTML doesnt hurt either.


## Basic YAML

### Here is a sample of the output.

This is called basic YAML because other than a `.csl` file for your references formatting, and a `.bib` file for your references, you wont need anything special other than Markdown know how to write a paper.

      This is a wonderful Title

    - Author 2^1,2^
    - Etc.^1,3^
    date: \scriptsize^1^ University of Somewhere ^2^ Imaginary College ^3^ Mans Greatest Hospital
    output:
      pdf_document:
      word_document: default
      html_document:
        df_print: paged
    #classoption:
    #- twocolumn #allows for double column
    bibliography:
    - all_the_best_refs.bib
    header-includes: 
    - \usepackage{setspace}\doublespacing # makes for double spacing
    - \usepackage[switch, pagewise, running]{lineno} #switch allows it to be used with double column
    - \linenumbers # adds line numbers
    - \renewcommand\linenumberfont{\normalfont\small} #changes size of line numbers
    keywords: 'Keywords: first, Second, Third'
    csl: journal-of-the-american-college-of-surgeons.csl #citation format, in this case makes in text numbers, and numbers the ref section.
    abstract: |-
     \singlespacing This is my dream abstract. 
  
  
     **Keywords: first, second, third**
 
    ---

Then after the YAML use:

    \twocolumn
    \doublespacing
    <!--\newpage-->
    \pagewiselinenumbers
To start double spacing, double column, and line numbers

And then at the end near references, to return to single spacing and single column

    \newpage
    \singlespacing
    \onecolumn
    # References

## Augemented YAML
This is 'augmented' because additional formatting `.lua` files are need, which if you can just keep in the same directory as the `.Rmd` file you are writing. 
For this you will need:

* `author-info-blocks.lua`
* `scholarly-metadata.lua`

and to knit to word I used:

* `Reference_Document.docx`

These files can all be obtained at in my [Git Repo](https://github.com/tpfeeney/academic_paper_in_markdown/tree/master/augmented_yaml)

And include the beginning:

    \twocolumn
    \doublespacing
    <!--\newpage-->
    \pagewiselinenumbers
    \begin{center}
    \textbf{Introduction:}
    \end{center}

And ending as before.

    \newpage
    \singlespacing
    \onecolumn
    # References

To include R code and figures/tables after references include this bit

    <div id="refs"></div>
    
    \newpage

## Summary

I hope this is somewhat helpful. Please see my [Git repo](https://github.com/tpfeeney/academic_paper_in_markdown) for output from these and the files needed to make this work.

## Future Directions

* Figure out how to include inline tables
* Figure out how to include Tikz graphics and DAGs; likely will need `TikzDevice` for this.
