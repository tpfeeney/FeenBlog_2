The internet has a plethora of resources to learn more about science, math, and other interests. I decided to collate all my favorite sites and posts.


## [**Statistical Rethinking**](https://xcelab.net/rm/)

Richard McElreath's [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.crcpress.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919) book is famous (at least is seems to be). Its fantastic for both learning statistical thinking, but also learning bayesian analysis from the ground up. The most wonderful part of it, for those of use who havent taken multivariate calculus, is that he teaches without requring it. It also comes paired with a [wonderful lecture video series provided for free](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJK6_DZvcMqNSzQdEkzvzA).

## **Solomon Kurz's R coding**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1220358159593766913')
```

Solomon's main page is [here](https://solomonkurz.netlify.com/) and he offers many great things. If you go to the [book length projects](https://solomonkurz.netlify.com/bookdown/) site you will see that there are many great reanalysis "books" where Solomon uses tidyverse and ggplot to complete aompanion analysis for [John Kruschke's Doing Bayesian Data Analysis](https://bookdown.org/content/3686/), [Andrew Hayes' Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis](https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/recoding_Hayes_2018/), and of course last but not least the most popular reanalysis, that of [Richard McElreath's (see above) Statistical Rethinking](https://bookdown.org/content/3890/).

Solomon also has a great blog with posts like [Make model diagrams, Kruschke style](https://solomonkurz.netlify.com/post/make-model-diagrams-kruschke-style/)

## [**Causal Inference Book**](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/)

How could I ignore this resource--I would need to be daft to! I used this book by Robins and Hernan  extensively during both my intro epi course and my casual inference course while completing my MPH (luckily Hernan was my causal inference instructor). The link to the webpage is [here](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) and includes a link to the [free pdf](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/2020/02/ci_hernanrobins_21feb20.pdf) and code for SAS, Stata, and R.

There is also a nicely done [bookdown project](https://causalinferencebookr.netlify.com/) by [Malcolm Barrett](https://malco.io/) that works through the coding for the book and is a wonderful companion.

## [**R Psychologist**](https://rpsychologist.com/)

Wonderful [visualizations](https://rpsychologist.com/tag/visualization)

## [**Sam Finlayson's Site**](https://sgfin.github.io/)

[DAGs](https://sgfin.github.io/2019/06/19/Causal-Inference-Book-All-DAGs/)

[Causal Inference Notes](https://sgfin.github.io/2019/06/19/Causal-Inference-Book-Glossary-and-Notes/)

## [**Stat 110 Probability by Joseph Blitzstein**](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110)
This is an amazing first course covering probability. Not only does it link to his [amazing youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo), [handouts](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/handouts), [practice problems and solutions](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/strategic-practice-problems), a free copy of [his book](http://probabilitybook.net/), but it also has the added content from his EdX course. Joe is an amazing resource and I cant recommend all this enough.
