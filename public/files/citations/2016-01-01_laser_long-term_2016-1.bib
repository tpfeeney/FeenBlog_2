  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The short-term natural history of blunt cerebrovascular injuries (BCVIs) has been previously described in the literature, but the purpose of this study was to analyze long-term serial follow-up and lesion progression of BCVI.
METHODS: This is a single institution's retrospective review of a prospectively collected database over four years (2009\textendash{}2013). All patients with a diagnosis of BCVI by computed tomographic (CT) scan were identified, and injuries were graded based on modified Denver scale. Management followed institutional algorithm: initial whole-body contrast-enhanced CT scan, followed by CT angiography at 24 to 72 hours, 5 to 7 days, 4 to 6 weeks, and 3 months after injury. All follow-up imaging, medication management, and clinical outcomes through 6 months following injury were recorded.
RESULTS: There were 379 patients with 509 injuries identified. Three hundred eighty-one injuries were diagnosed as BCVI on first CT (Grade 1 injuries, 126; Grade 2 injuries, 116; Grade 3 injuries, 69; and Grade 4 injuries, 70); 100 ``indeterminate'' on whole-body CT; 28 injuries were found in patients reimaged only for lesions detected in other vessels. Sixty percent were male, mean (SD) age was 46.5 (19.9)years, 65\% were white, and 62\% were victims of a motor vehicle crash. Most frequently, Grade 1 injuries were resolved at all subsequent time points. Up to 30\% of Grade 2 injuries worsened, but nearly 50\% improved or resolved. Fortysix percent of injuries originally not detected were subsequently diagnosed as Grade 3 injuries. Greater than 70\% of all imaged Grade 3 and Grade 4 injuries remained unchanged at all subsequent time points.
