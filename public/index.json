[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Hi! My name is Tim, and I am a Post Doc at Boston University. I have an MD and clinical training in general surgery. My interests are very broad and encompass every corner of STEM fields. I have always wanted to be a scientist in some capacity. Originally when I was very young it was paleontolgy, and then astrophysics, and then an amalgam of other fields. I eventually landed on molecular biology and medicine after falling in love in undergrad\u0026ndash;I always loved the combination of physics, physical chem, and chem when combined with biology, which molecular biology does well. During medical training, I developed a love of biostatistics and epidemiology as a way to study disease and combine a bunch of my interests: molecular biology, physiology, mathematics, computer science.\nMy broad research interests are outcomes after surgery. I am specifically interested in ways to improve care, and understanding how social determinants of health impact outcomes after surgery. One of my major projects during my post doc has been evaluating how limited english proficiency impacts outcomes after surgery. Another research interest of mine are incidental masses. As such, my other major ongoing project during my post doc has been a prospective study evaluating a mulimodal approach to improving follow up after identification of an incidental adrenal mass.\nMy interests outside of science and math involve SCUBA diving on deep wrecks and in caves. I have also spent a large chunk of my life as a firefighter and an EMT.\nDisclaimer: This website is a work in progress.

I decided to collate all my favorite sites and posts.\nStatistical Rethinking Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking book is famous (at least is seems to be). Its fantastic for both learning statistical thinking, but also learning bayesian analysis from the ground up. The most wonderful part of it, for those of use who havent taken multivariate calculus, is that he teaches without requring it. It also comes paired with a wonderful lecture video series provided for free.\nYou can also follow him on twitter \\(@\\)rlmcelreath\n Solomon Kurz’s R coding @SolomonKurz is a gift. https://t.co/rzjpPjpK87\n\u0026mdash; Tim Feeney (@Tfeend) January 23, 2020  Solomon’s main page is here and he offers many great things. If you go to the book length projects site you will see that there are many great reanalysis “books” where Solomon uses tidyverse and ggplot to complete aompanion analysis for John Kruschke’s Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, Andrew Hayes’ Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis, and of course last but not least the most popular reanalysis, that of Richard McElreath’s (see above) Statistical Rethinking.\nSolomon also has a great blog with posts like Make model diagrams, Kruschke style\nYou can also follow him on twitter \\(@\\)SolomonKurz\n Causal Inference Book How could I ignore this resource–I would need to be daft to! I used this book by Robins and Hernan extensively during both my intro epi course and my casual inference course while completing my MPH (luckily Hernan was my causal inference instructor).

We conducted a retrospective review of 2321 adult patients (age $\\geq$18) who died within 6 months of admission to Boston Medical Center from 2012 to 2017. Patients were included for analysis if their length of stay was more than 48 hours and if, based on their diagnoses as determined by literature review and expert consensus, they would have benefited from PCC. Bayesian regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 99\\% credible intervals (CrI) of receiving PCC adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance status, median income, and comorbidity status. Among the 739 patients who fit the inclusion criteria, only 30\\% (n = 222) received PCC even though 664 (90\\%) and 75 (10\\%) of these patients were identified as warranting PCC on medical and surgical services, respectively. Of the 222 patients who received PCC, 214 (96\\%) were cared for by medical services and 8 (4\\%) were cared for by surgical services. Patients cared for primarily by surgical were significantly less likely to receive PCC than primary patients of medical service providers (OR, 0.19, 99\\% CrI, 0.056-0.48). At our institution, many surgical patients appropriate for PCC are unable to benefit from this service due to low consultation numbers. Further investigation is warranted to examine if this phenomenon is observed at other institutions, elucidate the reasons for this disparity, and develop interventions to increase the appropriate use of PCC throughout all medical specialties.","tags":[],"title":"Differential Utilization of Palliative Care Consultation Between Medical and Surgical Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothy Feeney","Stephanie Talutis","Megan Janeway","Praveen Sridhar","Avneesh Gupta","Philip E.

I argue that this is complete malarkey, and I want to talk about why.\nLets put aside the discussion of the use of p-values for a moment. If have results that are not \u0026ldquo;statistically significant,\u0026rdquo; according to your preset alpha level, you have determined that your results are not very unlikely given that your null hypothesis is true. Hence, what you have is a result from a sample that is slightly more extreme than you would expect, but has not crossed your threshold of unlikely, and what you see in your sample result is just due to chance. Now, at this point people say, \u0026ldquo;but, this is clinically meaningful.\u0026rdquo; For instance, say survival time was 5 months extra in your sample, which you did not find statistically significant. Then while 5 extra months would be meaningful to a patient, you have no data to suggest your treatment in this case does anything\u0026ndash;you just sampled in a way where you observed a survival of five months more.\nNow this is not to say you cant have a statistically significant result that ISNT clinically meaningful. There are probably many results like this. For instance, is one extra month of life with a treatment meaningful? Or how about a half a day longer surgical stay; is that meaningful?\n","date":1528588800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528588800,"objectID":"bead1f198f1f61a01489fdea88bc73f0","permalink":"/post/clinical-significance-why-there-is-nothing-significant-about-it/","publishdate":"2018-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/clinical-significance-why-there-is-nothing-significant-about-it/","section":"post","summary":"I saw a post on twitter recently regarding clinical significance of statistically non-significant findings.

They were both great, but it became apparent during that time that serious stat were done with R. Further, visualizations that I saw from R packages like ggplot were just so much prettier than anything I saw in SAS or Stata.\nThere were no specific classes to learn R during my MPH, but I was able to teach myself by taking free online class, googling answer, and just experimenting with my data and comparing it to other software I already knew. It wasnt easy, but it has been worth it.\nThrough this time I have developed a very strong position on the different stats packages and I thought I would go through my thoughts on them now. In short, R is the best, Stata is OK, and SAS should just be avoided.\nStata: this was the first stats program I was exposed to, and it was used to help me learn basic biostatistics. It is a good package. It is really easy to learn, particularly for someone without any programming background (like myself). The interface is instuitive, running tests and regressions are strightforward and tend to use natural language syntax instead of more complex syntax of SAS and R. Oh, and it allows for additional pakcages to be added on. I have use these packages for things like multiple testing adjustments and graphing quantile regression output. In essence Stata offers simple straightforward analysis that is advanced, easy to get going in, and with at least some upgradability.\nSAS. Oh SAS. How I hate thee. I understand that there was a time when SAS was THE SOFTWARE to use to analyze data. R wasnt nearly as developed, Stata didnt exist, and doing things by hand wasnt really an option. So, I understand why previous generations used it, and since they have all this experience with it they continue to hold on. BUT, times have changed, and for a newcomer SAS is terrible. First, its hard as hell to get a hold of. You can get a free education version, but that is severely limited. It isnt native to a unix environment, so those with linux and macs need to virtualize, and it is EXPENSIVE. Couple these \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo; with its steep learning curve, and you have a conflagration of awful. I remember how hard it was to learn SAS AND learn regression\u0026ndash;it was atrocious. The learning curve is just too high for minimal payoff above Stata. If you are going to sacrifice ease of use you might as well just use R.\nR is an open source (read: free) software package built for data analysis. It is by no means easy to use; far from it in fact. The learning curve is steep, which is similar to SAS. BUT, R is infinitely expandable and VERY powerful. Not to mention it comes with a huge community of users that are helpful, great visualization packages, and tha ability to actually program your own additional functions. Moreover, it can be used for more than just data analysis. I am writing this blog using R and it is a wonderful experience. Last, a feature of R that is often overlooked is that it FORCES you to know what you are doing. In stata, things happen behind the scenes and outputs are given to you without much user thought. For instance, after running a regression you can use the postestimation command: lroc, and voila\u0026rsquo; you get a ROC with a calculated AUROC. It\u0026rsquo;s nice and convenient, but in R you have to do a bit more. You have to run the regression, and then understand that you need to predict the output for each individual and then compare that to the actual outcome in the individual to get and ROC. In that way R teaches while you perform functions, because there is more to success than a simple command.\nIn the end, getting away from SAS will be benefitial for everyone. Start and stick with Stata, and learn R if you want to do more and be even better, but dont even bother with SAS since the cost effectivness of what you can do given time to learn is just not worth it. I have made a little table below to summarize my opinions.\n   Feature Stata SAS R     Expense high high FREE   Learning Curve low high very high   Expandibility moderate low very high   Power moderate high very high    ","date":1528588800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528588800,"objectID":"2e10ab5d581246c9cc778c96930af949","permalink":"/post/stats-software-compared-a-n00bs-viewpoint/","publishdate":"2018-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/stats-software-compared-a-n00bs-viewpoint/","section":"post","summary":"While in my MPH training I had the opportunity to use (in class) both Stata and SAS.

Of particular interest is the safety of patients undergoing surgeries with trainee surgeons. The aim of this study was to identify if there were significant differences in outcomes of patients undergoing commonly performed thyroid and parathyroid surgeries when trainees were involved. Materials and methods: Postoperative complication rates, length of stay (LOS), and total operation time (OT) data were gathered from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database. The cases were identified by CPT code and were divided based on the training level of the participating resident surgeon: Junior (postgraduate year [PGY] 1-2), senior (PGY 3-5), fellow (PGY $$5), as well as an attending-only group where no resident was present. We compared the clinical outcomes, LOS, and OT in each trainee group to the attending-only group as the reference. Results: A total of 84,711 cases were identified of which 45.33\\% involved trainee participation. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\\% confidence interval for overall, neurologic, and bleeding complications were calculated. No difference in the odds of overall patient complications or neurologic complications was observed. A decrease in the odds of bleedings complications when a junior or senior trainee was present was observed. Overall complications in operations including a junior trainee (PGY 1-2) had an OR of 1.04 (0.85, 1.29), a senior trainee (PGY 3-5) had an OR of 1.00 (0.89, 1.13), and a fellow had an OR of 0.98 (0.74, 1.31). Mean OT was found to be significantly different between attending only and junior and senior trainees. There was no significant difference in OT between fellows and attending only. LOS did not meaningfully differ across groups. Conclusions: In three commonly performed thyroid and parathyroid operations, there is not an increased overall or neurologic complication odds when a surgical trainee is involved; there are decreased odds of a bleeding complication.","tags":[],"title":"Resident and Fellow Participation in Thyroid and Parathyroid Surgery: An ACS-NSQIP Clinical Outcomes Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The Science DMZ model is an established solution to help maximize the throughput from any given network infrastructure between sites but there still exists room for exploration and improvement, including the use of Software-Defined Networking (SDN). We aim to explore how the use of SDN-enabled flows in a Science DMZ may impact its main trait: performance. In this paper we have successfully demonstrated improvements in data transfer between certain sites and under certain conditions. Though we have also seen sites where there is no difference or even a performance penalty, all the results are consistent and reproducible over hundreds of test transfers suggesting there are unique properties of each site configuration leading to real and sustained performance increases to a Science DMZ.","tags":[],"title":"Data Transfer in a Science DMZ Using SDN with Applications for Precision Medicine in Cloud and High-Performance Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Margaret H.

However, little is known about the natural history of BCVI4 and the pathophysiology of subsequent stroke formation. METHODS: A 4-year review of patients with BCVI4 at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center was performed. Rates of BCVI4-related stroke, stroke-related mortality, and overall mortality were calculated. The relationship of change in vessel characteristics and BCVI4-related stroke was examined, as was the mechanism of stroke formation. RESULTS: There were 82 BCVI4s identified, with 13 carotid artery (ICA) and 69 vertebral artery BCVI4s. BCVI4-related stroke rate was 2.9\\% in vertebral artery BCVI4 and 70\\% in ICA BCVI4 patients surviving to reimaging. Stroke mechanisms included embolic strokes, thrombotic strokes, and combined embolic and thrombotic strokes. Peristroke vessel recanalization and an embolic stroke mechanism were seen in 100\\% of ICA BCVI4-related strokes developing after admission. BCVI4-related stroke occurred within 10 hours of hospital admission in 67\\% of the patients with strokes. Contraindications to anticoagulation were present in most patients with BCVI4-related stroke developing after admission.

Six enzymes, N-acetylglutamate synthase, carbamylphosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthase, argininosuccinate lyase and arginase 1 (ARG1) are essential for ureagenesis. Most urea cycle disorders result from mutations in coding regions or splice sites, but regulatory region changes may also contribute. To analyze urea cycle transcriptional regulation we used Cis-Element Over Representation (CLOVER) software to find transcription factor binding motifs in conserved regions. Candidate binding sites for Estrogen Receptor and BRCA1 were found in the ARG1 promoter. Binding will be verified using an avidin-agarose pull down assay and western blotting. We also screened patients with OTC deficiency that lack typical mutations, for changes in OTC regulatory regions. We identified three single nucleotide substitutions as disease-causing candidates in the OTC promoter; two in a known HNF-4 binding site and one in a conserved region of unknown function. These changes were absent in 800 alleles from persons of Caucasian, Hispanic and African decent. Bioinformatic detection and molecular verification of regulatory factors is critical to understanding the urea cycle and for better diagnosis of disease.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of Urea Cycle Gene Transcription Regulation Using Bioinformatic Software and Patient Sequences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abigail Leavitt LaBella","Timothy Feeney","Sandra Kirsch Heibel","Mendel Tuchman","Ljubica Caldovic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"dffb1f34c348db02904e726bb022fbea","permalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_labella_comprehensive_2011/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-01-01_labella_comprehensive_2011/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Comprehensive Bioinformatic Analysis of Urea Cycle Gene Transcription Regulation Using Cis-Element over Representation (CLOVER) Software and Patient Sequences to Identify Disease Causing Mutations","type":"publication"}]
